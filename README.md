'A Terrible Dungeon Crawl' contains the following files:
  -tdc.js
  -battle.js
  -index.html
  -style.css

It makes use of standard js, html, and css functionality, in addition to:
  -jQuery (https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.0.min.js)
  -google fonts (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Press+Start+2P)
  -svg (http://www.w3.org/2000/svg)
  -USGS data supplied via API (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)

It can be accessed with the following link (for the time being):
  -https://shererstress.github.io/

For 'installation', copy index.html, and the 'terrible_dungeon_crawl' directory, arrange them in the same manner as they are here, and open 'index.html' in google chrome (I can't guarantee it will work in the slightest in any other browser)
